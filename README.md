This site was created with bootstrap as the front-end framework. SCSS and vanilla JS was used for the entirety of the project.

The portfolio was designed with mobile first in mind. Below 1200px my work section will be a one column layout. Navbar will be displayed in a hamburger menu. 
1200px and above my work section will have a “broken” layout and the navbar will be fully displayed.

Navbar hamburger menu when clicked will animate to the left and transition into an X. It will also darken the background as the menu slides out to the left.

Every section on the portfolio has a fade animation that is triggered using the IntersectionObserver API.
